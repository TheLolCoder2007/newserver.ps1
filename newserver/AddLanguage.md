# Huge thanks to you if you want to translate my project.
### Here is the plan:
1. Fork this repository
2. Translate the english sentences, given in comments after the variable in [template.lang.ps1](./template.lang.ps1) to the places between the \"\'s
3. Fork back
### That's it! You will get credits when the template is loaded (via the Write-Host cmdlet, translate that, too!)
